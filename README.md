# Elements-Crush
This repository contains the Elements Crush game

I made this game for my final project in CS course in highschool last year. For the final project every student
had to come up with an idea for the game, write the proposal, create UML diagrams for classes and write the game
using principles of OOP on JAVA. 

This is a three-in-the-row game, it can be played from Windows computer.
